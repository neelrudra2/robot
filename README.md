# ü¶æ Multi-Robot Warehouse Automation Simulator

A Python-based simulation of autonomous warehouse robots performing **parcel pickup, routing, and delivery** using **A\*** pathfinding, dynamic task allocation, and real-time route replanning.  
This project models the core logic behind **robotic warehouse automation systems** like those developed by companies such as **Unbox Robotics** and **GreyOrange**.

## üöÄ Overview

This simulator demonstrates how multiple robots can collaboratively execute delivery tasks within a warehouse grid.  
Each robot autonomously:
- Finds the nearest parcel to pick up.
- Plans an optimal route using **A\*** pathfinding.
- Avoids collisions and dynamically replans when paths are blocked.
- Delivers parcels to their assigned destination bins.

The system runs entirely in software ‚Äî **no hardware required** ‚Äî and visualizes robot movement and task execution using **Matplotlib animations**.
